# hw definition file for processing by chibios_pins.py
# Aocoda-RC-F405V2 MPU6500/MPU6000

# This hwdef.dat file contains a lot of comments so it can act as a
# reference for developers adding new boards.

# The hwdef.dat file defines all the hardware peripherals and pins for
# a port of ArduPilot to a board using the ChibiOS HAL. You should be
# able to write the hwdef.dat file for a new board with just the
# schematic for the board.

# This file is processed by chibios_hwdef.py to create hwdef.h for
# this board. You may find it useful to run chibios_hwdef.py manually
# when building this file for a new board. The resulting hwdef.h file
# is formatted to make it quite readable. It is strongly suggested
# that you read the resulting hwdef.h file when porting to a new board
# to make sure it has resulted in what you want.

# You should read this file in conjunction with the schematic for your
# board, the datasheet for the MCU for your board and the python
# tables file that we have extracted from the datasheet for your
# MCU. The python tables file is particularly important, so if you
# haven't seen it before go and look at it now. For the STM32F427 it
# it called STM32F427xx.py and it is in the hwdef/script/ directory
# inside the HAL_ChibiOS directory. That file tells you what each pin
# can do (the alternate functions table) and what DMA channels can be
# used for each peripheral type. The alternative functions table is
# particularly useful when doing a new hwdef.dat file as you can work
# out peripheral numbers given a port/pin name.

# We need to start off by saying what main CPU is on the board. There
# are two CPU identifiers that you need to specify. The first is the
# ChibiOS MCU type. The second string needs to match the name of a config
# file in the libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef/script directory. 
# In this case we are using a H743 MCU, so we select STM32H743xx to match the
# STM32H743xx.py file in the script directory. If you are supporting a
# board type that doesn't have a python hardware database file yet
# then you will need to create one. There are scripts in the scripts
# directory to help with that by parsing the STM32 datasheets to
# extract the required DMA and alternate function tables.

# MCU class and specific type
MCU STM32F4xx STM32F405xx

# Now we need to specify the APJ_BOARD_ID. This is the ID that the
# bootloader presents to GCS software so it knows if this firmware is
# suitable for the board. Please see
# https://github.com/ArduPilot/Bootloader/blob/master/hw_config.h for
# a list of current board IDs. If you add a new board type then please
# get it added to that repository so we don't get conflicts.

# Note that APJ is "ArduPilot JSON Firmware Format".

# board ID for firmware load
APJ_BOARD_ID 5211

# Now you need to say what crystal frequency you have for this
# board. All of the clocks are scaled against this. Typical values are
# 24000000 or 8000000.

# On some boards you will need to also set the various PLL values. See
# the defaults in common/mcuconf.h, and use the define mechanism
# explained later in this file to override values suitable for your
# board. Refer to your MCU datasheet or examples from supported boards
# in ChibiOS for the right values.

# Now define the voltage the MCU runs at. This is needed for ChibiOS
# to set various internal driver limits. It is in 0.01 volt units.


# This is the STM32 timer that ChibiOS will use for the low level
# driver. This must be a 32 bit timer. We currently only support

# Now define the order that I2C buses are presented in the hal.i2c API
# in ArduPilot. For historical reasons inherited from HAL_PX4 the
# 'external' I2C bus should be bus 1 in hal.i2c, and internal I2C bus
# should be bus 0. On fmuv3 the STM32 I2C1 is our external bus and
# I2C2 is our internal bus, so we need to setup the order as I2C2
# followed by I2C1 in order to achieve the conventional order that
# drivers expect.

# Now define the primary battery connectors. The labels we choose here
# are used to create defines for pins in the various drivers, so
# choose names that match existing board setups where possible. Here
# we define two pins PA2 and PA3 for voltage and current sensing, with

# Now the serial ordering. These map to the SERIALn_ parameter numbers
# If you use a shorter list then HAL_Empty::UARTDriver
# objects are substituted for later UARTs, or you can leave a gap by
# listing one or more of the uarts as EMPTY.

# The normal usage of this ordering is:
# 1) SERIAL0: console (primary mavlink, usually USB)
# 2) SERIAL1: GPS
# 3) SERIAL2: RC input
# 4) SERIAL3: ESC Telemetry
# 5) SERIAL4: VTX
# 6) SERIAL5: Telemetry

# order of UARTs (and USB)
SERIAL_ORDER OTG1  USART1 USART2 USART3 UART4 UART5

# Now we start on the pin definitions. Every pin used by ArduPilot
# needs to be in this file. The pins in this file can be defined in any order.

# The format is P+port+pin. So PC4 is portC pin4.
# For every pin the second column is the label. If this is a
# peripheral that has an alternate function defined in the STM32
# datasheet then the label must be the name of that alternative
# function. The names are looked up in the python database for this
# MCU. Please see STM32F427xx.py for the F427 database. That database
# is used to automatically fill in the alternative function (and later
# for the DMA channels).

# The third column is the peripheral type. This must be one of the
# following: UARTn, USARTn, OTGn, SPIn, I2Cn, ADCn, TIMn, SWD, SDIO,
# INPUT, OUTPUT, CS.

# The fourth and later columns are for modifiers on the pin. The
# possible modifiers are:
# pin speed: SPEED_VERYLOW, SPEED_LOW, SPEED_MEDIUM, SPEED_HIGH
# pullup: PULLUP, PULLDOWN, FLOATING
# out type: OPENDRAIN, PUSHPULL
# default value: LOW, HIGH

# Additionally, each class of pin peripheral can have extra modifiers
# suitable for that pin type. For example, for an OUTPUT you can map
# it to a GPIO number in hal.gpio using the GPIO(n) modifier. For ADC
# inputs you can apply a scaling factor (to bring it to unit volts)
# using the SCALE(x) modifier. See the examples below for more
# modifiers, or read the python code in chibios_hwdef.py.

# Now we define UART4 which is for the GPS. Be careful
# of the difference between USART and UART. Check the STM32F427xx.py
# if unsure which it is. For a UART we need to specify at least TX and
# RX pins.

# USART1 (GPS), SERIAL1
PA9 USART1_TX USART1  
PA10 USART1_RX USART1 

# USART2 (RC input), SERIAL2
PA2 USART2_TX USART2 
PA3 TIM9_CH2 TIM9 RCININT PULLDOWN LOW

# as an alternative config setup the RX6 pin as a uart. This allows
# for bi-directional UART based receiver protocols such as FPort
# without any extra hardware

# USART3 (ESC Telemetry), SERIAL3

# UART5 (Telemetry), SERIAL4

# Now we start defining some PWM pins. We also map these pins to GPIO
# values, so users can set BRD_PWM_COUNT to choose how many of the PWM
# outputs on the primary MCU are setup as PWM and how many as
# GPIOs. To match HAL_PX4 we number the GPIOs for the PWM outputs
# starting at 50.

# Now the SPI device table. This table creates all accessible SPI
# devices, giving the name of the device (which is used by device
# drivers to open the device), plus which SPI bus it it on, what
# device ID will be used (which controls the IDs used in parameters
# such as COMPASS_DEV_ID, so we can detect when the list of devices
# changes between reboots for calibration purposes), the SPI mode to
# use, and the low and high speed settings for the device.

# You can define more SPI devices than you actually have, to allow for
# flexibility in board setup, and the driver code can probe to see
# which are responding.

# The DEVID values and device names are chosen to match the PX4 port
# of ArduPilot so users don't need to re-do their accel and compass
# calibrations when moving to ChibiOS.
