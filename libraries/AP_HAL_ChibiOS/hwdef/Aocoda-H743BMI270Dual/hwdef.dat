# hw definition file for processing by chibios_pins.py
# for AOCODARC H743 Dual, and it's for Daniel's copter:
# Version 30: BMI270 + DPS310 + X8(4 motor with bddshot used)

# This hwdef.dat file contains a lot of comments so it can act as a
# reference for developers adding new boards.

# The hwdef.dat file defines all the hardware peripherals and pins for
# a port of ArduPilot to a board using the ChibiOS HAL. You should be
# able to write the hwdef.dat file for a new board with just the
# schematic for the board.

# This file is processed by chibios_hwdef.py to create hwdef.h for
# this board. You may find it useful to run chibios_hwdef.py manually
# when building this file for a new board. The resulting hwdef.h file
# is formatted to make it quite readable. It is strongly suggested
# that you read the resulting hwdef.h file when porting to a new board
# to make sure it has resulted in what you want.

# You should read this file in conjunction with the schematic for your
# board, the datasheet for the MCU for your board and the python
# tables file that we have extracted from the datasheet for your
# MCU. The python tables file is particularly important, so if you
# haven't seen it before go and look at it now. For the STM32F427 it
# it called STM32F427xx.py and it is in the hwdef/script/ directory
# inside the HAL_ChibiOS directory. That file tells you what each pin
# can do (the alternate functions table) and what DMA channels can be
# used for each peripheral type. The alternative functions table is
# particularly useful when doing a new hwdef.dat file as you can work
# out peripheral numbers given a port/pin name.

# We need to start off by saying what main CPU is on the board. There
# are two CPU identifiers that you need to specify. The first is the
# ChibiOS MCU type. The second string needs to match the name of a config
# file in the libraries/AP_HAL_ChibiOS/hwdef/script directory. 
# In this case we are using a H743 MCU, so we select STM32H743xx to match the
# STM32H743xx.py file in the script directory. If you are supporting a
# board type that doesn't have a python hardware database file yet
# then you will need to create one. There are scripts in the scripts
# directory to help with that by parsing the STM32 datasheets to
# extract the required DMA and alternate function tables.

# MCU class and specific type
MCU STM32H7xx STM32H743xx

# Now we need to specify the APJ_BOARD_ID. This is the ID that the
# bootloader presents to GCS software so it knows if this firmware is
# suitable for the board. Please see
# https://github.com/ArduPilot/Bootloader/blob/master/hw_config.h for
# a list of current board IDs. If you add a new board type then please
# get it added to that repository so we don't get conflicts.

# Note that APJ is "ArduPilot JSON Firmware Format".

# board ID for firmware load

# Now you need to say what crystal frequency you have for this
# board. All of the clocks are scaled against this. Typical values are
# 24000000 or 8000000.

# On some boards you will need to also set the various PLL values. See

# explained later in this file to override values suitable for your
# board. Refer to your MCU datasheet or examples from supported boards
# in ChibiOS for the right values.

# This is the STM32 timer that ChibiOS will use for the low level

# Now define which UART is used for printf(). We rarely use printf()
# in ChibiOS, so this is really only for debugging very early startup
# in drivers.

# Serial port for stdout. This is optional. If you leave it out then
# output from printf() lines will go to the ArduPilot console, which is the
# first UART in the SERIAL_ORDER list.  But note that some startup code
# runs before USB is set up. 
# The value for STDOUT_SERIAL is a serial device name, and must be for a

# is for UART7 (SD7 == "serial device 7" in ChibiOS).

# Now the USB setup, if you have USB. All of these settings are
# option, and the ones below are the defaults. It ends up creating a

# Now we start on the pin definitions. Every pin used by ArduPilot
# needs to be in this file. The pins in this file can be defined in any order.

# The format is P+port+pin. So PC4 is portC pin4.
# For every pin the second column is the label. If this is a
# peripheral that has an alternate function defined in the STM32
# datasheet then the label must be the name of that alternative
# function. The names are looked up in the python database for this
# MCU. Please see STM32F427xx.py for the F427 database. That database
# is used to automatically fill in the alternative function (and later
# for the DMA channels).

# The third column is the peripheral type. This must be one of the
# following: UARTn, USARTn, OTGn, SPIn, I2Cn, ADCn, TIMn, SWD, SDIO,
# INPUT, OUTPUT, CS.

# The fourth and later columns are for modifiers on the pin. The
# possible modifiers are:
# pin speed: SPEED_VERYLOW, SPEED_LOW, SPEED_MEDIUM, SPEED_HIGH
# pullup: PULLUP, PULLDOWN, FLOATING
# out type: OPENDRAIN, PUSHPULL
# default value: LOW, HIGH

# Additionally, each class of pin peripheral can have extra modifiers
# suitable for that pin type. For example, for an OUTPUT you can map
# it to a GPIO number in hal.gpio using the GPIO(n) modifier. For ADC
# inputs you can apply a scaling factor (to bring it to unit volts)
# using the SCALE(x) modifier. See the examples below for more
# modifiers, or read the python code in chibios_hwdef.py.

# Now we define UART4 which is for the GPS. Be careful
# of the difference between USART and UART. Check the STM32F427xx.py
# if unsure which it is. For a UART we need to specify at least TX and
# RX pins.

# Now we start defining some PWM pins. We also map these pins to GPIO
